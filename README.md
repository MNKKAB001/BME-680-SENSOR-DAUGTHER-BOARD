# BME-680-SENSOR-DAUGTHER-BOARD
The design of the project was to create a sensor for a raspberry pi, microprocessor which contains different GPOI pins up to 40 of the pin the main pins that the user will mainly use is the I2C pin, SDA I2C, SCL I2C and the power pin of 3v3  which are the connected to the daughter board via female to female wire which the configures the communication, using a python code the BME can easily communicate with the raspberry pi zero w, the sensor is known as multisensory board since it can sense different environmental aspect like humidity, temperature and pressure.
